The project focused on creating an integrated platform to bridge the gap between service providers and the homeless population, improving access to essential resources. We identified the communication barriers among service providers and addressed them through better coordination. A predictive model was implemented to optimize the placement of kiosks that share nearby resource information. This initiative aimed to enhance accessibility and support for the homeless community.

[![ML-thumbnail](assets/img/ML-thumbnail.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tj6O-cbkmosb_dyG1--9vEEtJirbQvTP/view?usp=sharing)
This project predicts the performance of Playstore apps using machine learning. It uses a dataset from Kaggle with information on over 10,000 apps, including attributes like reviews, size, installs, and ratings. Data cleaning and preprocessing involved handling missing values, converting columns to appropriate data types, and encoding categorical variables. Three models were used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and PCA with Logistic Regression. Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, but the models still showed room for improvement, suggesting further feature exploration or alternative models for better predictions

This project focuses on comparing recruitment and selection strategies of five major FMCG companies in India. It examines key recruitment sources, selection tests, hiring duration, and employee tenure. The study finds that while hiring practices are largely similar, variations exist in recruitment frequency, selection processes, and compensation. The findings offer insights into industry benchmarks and best practices for effective talent acquisition in the FMCG sector.
