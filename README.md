This presentation covers **"Data for Difference Making,"** exploring key insights and strategies. Analyzed the evolving landscape of community banking in the U.S. I examined historical impacts, demographic shifts, and challenges faced by unbanked and underbanked populations. This project focuses on AI-driven strategies to enhance financial accessibility, reduce banking deserts, and promote digital transactions in underserved communities. This experience strengthened my skills in data analysis, impact assessment, and strategic problem-solving, reinforcing my interest in leveraging technology to address complex industry challenges.
